title: Hams & The Community
---

Amateur radio users volunteer countless hours to the community.  By imposing
restrictive ordinances on antenna heights, Oceanside will be limiting the
ability of amateurs to transmit efficiently.  The ham community as a whole
provides a great deal of public service, not only in times of emergency, but
throughout every day life.

The [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/) webpage on [public
service](http://www.arrl.org/public-service) has many examples of the
volunteer work done by radio amateurs.

Ham Radio Operators are all integral parts of the following groups[^foot]:
