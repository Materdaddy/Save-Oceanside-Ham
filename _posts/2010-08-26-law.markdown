California Government Code Section 65850.3

>Any ordinance adopted by the legislative body of a city or
>county that regulates amateur radio station antenna structures shall
>allow those structures to be erected at heights and dimensions
>sufficient to accommodate amateur radio service communications, shall
>not preclude amateur radio service communications, shall reasonably
>accommodate amateur radio service communications, and shall
>constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish the city's
>or county's legitimate purpose.

>It is the intent of the Legislature in adding this section to the
>Government Code, to codify in state law the provisions of Section
>97.15 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which expresses
>the Federal Communications Commission's limited preemption of local
>regulations governing amateur radio station facilities.

The ordinance facing Oceanside residents will preclude most (if not all)
amateurs due to the high cost of a Conditional Use Permit, and the completely
unreasonable application administrative process we will be forced to follow.

For more information about the Conditional Use Permit (CUP), administrative
process, and associated fees, please see the [Article 39](/article-39.html)
