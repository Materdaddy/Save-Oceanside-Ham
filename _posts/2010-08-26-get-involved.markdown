Please e-mail the city council and encourage them to heed the advice given
by the community as well as the planning commission.  Specifically
recommendation 4 which the planning commission added for approval of the
draft.  Recommendation 4 was for the City Council to figure out a way to
lessen the impact of this article on ham radio users.

We recommend a complete exclusion of amateur operations/towers from the permit
process altogether.  We are licensed by the FCC and are granted permission
from the federal government to install and operate antennae without the need
for local ordinances and costly fees.  Please see the [law](/law.html) page for more details
