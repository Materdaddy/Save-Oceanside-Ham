<p>WD4DDY (Mat Mrosko) is a new licensed amateur in Oceanside.  I became
aware of this ordinance only a couple of weeks ago due to the helpful,
informative, and organized effort by AE6IC (Fred Atchley).</p>

<p>His e-mail list is great and very informative.  If you wish to join the
cause, please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I need help filling out more content on this site.  The plan is to
have the following sections (provided by Fred):</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Law - State, Federal and Congress</li>
	<li>The need for effective operation on 40 Meters - It's the backbone band</li>
	<li>The physical requirement for a half wavelength height - Ground effects</li>
	<li>The benefit to the community and to the country - Disaster relief</li>
	<li>The built-in bias against the ARS - Lumping with for-profit carriers</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with the following sections I added for the website:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contact</li>
	<li>Get Involved</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to help with the website, please <script type="text/javascript">
document.write('<n uers="znvygb:negvpyr39@zngzebfxb.pbz" ery="absbyybj">'.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){
return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);
}));</script>email Mat</a> to volunteer.  Currently I need help with all sections of the
site.  If you have information, links, or would like information put up,
please <script type="text/javascript">
