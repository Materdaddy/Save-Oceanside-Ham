<h4>We Won!</h4>

<p>Wednesday February 23rd, 2011 a revised Article 39A was approved by Oceanside
City Council.  This revised ordinance was drastically improved based on input
from fellow hams Tim McGovern, Jim Keller, Dennis Baca, and Fred Atchley.  The
new ordinance has the following requirements of an amateur operator installing a
tower greater than 51':</p>

<p><ul>
<li><em>Administrative Conditional Use Permit</em> - The fact that the permit is
administrative means instead of having to apply and get commission
approval, there is simply an application submitted to the city planning
office.</li>
<li><em>$500 Fee</em> - instead of the original Article 39's over $4,000 fee
since amateurs were lumped in with commercial for-profit companies erecting
towers.</li>
<li><em>Guy anchors and ground radials</em> - can be placed in the set back
area.  This is a 6-10 foot area surrounding the property lines where strutures
cannot infringe.</li>
<li><em>300 foot surrounding notice</em> - instead of the original 1,500 foot
surrounding notice area.</li>
</ul>
