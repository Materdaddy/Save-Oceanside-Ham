forever!</p>

<p>I'd like to give special thanks and recognition to Fred (<a

information you see on this website.  I (<a

don't have enough time to put this all together.  Without him this
website would not be possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/physics.html">Physics</a> - More information about ground effect on radio propagation</li>
<li><a href="/article-39.html">Article 39</a> - Breakdown of the proposed article (sections 3901-3911) with specific comments and how it relates to amateur radio.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><span style="color:red;">UPDATES (9/6):</span></em>
